# Linear Convolution

Linear convolution is a fundamental operation in signal processing and mathematics. It's used to combine two signals or sequences to form a third one. 

Linear convolution is a way to "mix" two signals (or sequences) by multiplying and summing them in a specific manner.

For 2 discrete-time signals $x(n)$ and $h(n)$ , their linear convouton is given by <br><br>
$$\sum_{l = 0}^{N - 1} x(l) h(n-l)$$
